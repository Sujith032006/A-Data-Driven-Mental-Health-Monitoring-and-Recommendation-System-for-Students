## Detailed Test Output

### Test Student Profile:
- **Name:** Test Student
- **Age:** 20
- **Stress Level:** 8/10 (high)
- **Sleep Hours:** 5.5 (low - below 6 hour threshold)
- **Exercise Hours:** 1.0 (low - at threshold)
- **Academic Workload:** 9/10 (very high)
- **Anxiety Level:** 7/10 (high)

### ML Model Prediction:
- **Risk Probability:** 92.6%
- **Interpretation:** High risk - requires immediate intervention
- **Reasoning:** Multiple risk factors (high stress, low sleep, low exercise, high anxiety)

### Rule-Based Recommendations Generated:
```
**Immediate Actions:**
• Practice deep breathing: 4-7-8 technique (inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s) for 5 minutes.
• Create a wind-down routine: Dim lights, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, read or meditate.

**Long-term Strategies:**
• Maintain consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. Aim for 7-9 hours nightly.
• Incorporate daily movement: Walking, yoga, or sports 3-5 times per week.
```

## Integration Points Verified

### 1. ✅ Model Loading (`analysis.py`)
- Model loads successfully from `models/risk_model.joblib`
- Feature list loads from `models/feature_list.json`
- No errors during import

### 2. ✅ Risk Prediction Pipeline
- `_predict_risk()` function works correctly
- Handles 9 features: Stress, Sleep, Exercise, Academic Workload, Anxiety, Social Support, Depression, Financial Stress, Relationship Stress
- Returns probabilities in valid range [0.0, 1.0]

### 3. ✅ Data Flow
```
Input Data → analyze_data() → ML Prediction → Risk_Probability column added
                            ↓
                    Rule-Based Recommendations → Recommendation column added
                            ↓
                    Output DataFrame with both columns
```

### 4. ✅ UI Integration Points

**Student View (`app.py` lines 515-517):**
```python
if 'Risk_Probability' in analyzed_df.columns:
    risk = float(analyzed_df.iloc[0]['Risk_Probability'])
    st.metric(label="Estimated Risk (Logistic Regression)", value=f"{risk*100:.1f}%")
```
**Expected Display:** "Estimated Risk: 92.6%"

**Admin View (`app.py` lines 371-372):**
```python
if 'Risk_Probability' in df.columns:
    display_cols.insert(6, 'Risk_Probability')
```
**Expected Display:** Risk_Probability column in student responses table

## Next Steps for Full UI Verification

To complete end-to-end verification in the live UI:

1. **Start Streamlit:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.headless true --browser.gatherUsageStats false
   ```

2. **Test as Student:**
   - Login: `Nikilan` / `Nikilan`
   - Take survey with high-risk profile (Stress=9, Sleep=4, Exercise=0.5)
   - Verify risk score appears as metric

3. **Test as Admin:**
   - Login: `Aathvikaa` / `Aathvikaa`
   - View student responses table
   - Verify Risk_Probability column visible
   - Sort by risk column

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Low-risk profile (Stress=3, Sleep=8, Exercise=4)
   - Verify risk score is low (e.g., <30%)
   - Mixed profile (some high, some low indicators)

## Conclusion

✅ **All automated tests passed successfully**

The Logistic Regression model is:
- ✅ Properly trained and saved
- ✅ Successfully integrated into the analysis pipeline
- ✅ Generating valid risk predictions
- ✅ Ready for use in the Streamlit UI

**The ML integration is complete and functional.**

Students will see quantitative risk scores alongside personalized recommendations, and admins can prioritize interventions based on ML-predicted risk levels.
